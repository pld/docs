We're currently working towards a 1.0 release and would love your feedback and proposed changes. Look at our current issue list and get involved! How it works User activity inside the clinician's workflow triggers CDS hooks in real-time. For example: patient-view when opening a new patient record medication-prescribe on authoring a new prescription order-review on viewing pending orders for approval When a triggering activity occurs, the CDS Client notifies each CDS service registered for the activity. These services must then provide near-real-time feedback about the triggering event. Each service gets basic details about the clinical workflow context (via the context parameter of the hook) plus whatever service-specific data are required (via the pre-fetch-template parameter). CDS Cards Each CDS service can return any number of cards in response to the hook. Cards convey some combination of text ( information card ), alternative suggestions ( suggestion card ), and links to apps or reference materials ( app link card ). A user sees these cards \u2014 one or more of each type \u2014 embedded in the workflow, and can interact with them as follows: information card : provides text for the user to read. suggestion card : provides a specific suggestion for which the CDS Client renders a button that the user can click to accept. Clicking automatically populates the suggested change into the clinician's UI. app link card : provides a link to an app (often a SMART app) where the user can supply details, step through a flowchart, or do anything else required to help reach an informed decision.

The best practices outlined here are not mandatory implementation rules; rather, they are suggested guidance. This is a living, in progress document and the best practices outlined here should not be considered absolute or complete. Security The CDS Hooks security model requires thought and consideration from implementers. Security topics are never binary, are often complex, and robust implementations should factor in concepts such as risk and usability. Implementers should approach their security related development with thoughtful care. The CDS Hooks specifications already provides some guidance in this space. The information here is supplemental to the existing specification documentation. The CDS Hooks security model leverages several existing RFCs. These should be read and fully understood by all implementers. rfc7519: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) rfc7517: JSON Web Key (JWK) rfc7515: JSON Web Signature (JWS) rfc7518: JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) CDS Clients Implementers of CDS Clients should: Maintain a whitelist of CDS Service endpoints that may be invoked. Only endpoints on the whitelist can be invoked. This ensures that CDS Clients invoke only trusted CDS Services. This is especially important since CDS Clients may send an authorization token that allows the CDS Service temporary access to the FHIR server. Issue secure FHIR access tokens. If a CDS Clients generates access tokens to its FHIR server, the tokens should: Be unique for each CDS Service endpoint. Be very short-lived. Provide the minimum necessary access for the CDS Service. This includes both SMART scopes as well as the patient(s)/data that can be accessed. CDS Services JWT Upon being invoked by a CDS Client, the CDS Service should first process the given JWT to determine whether to process the given request. In processing the JWT, CDS Services should: Ensure that the iss value exists in the CDS Service's whitelist of trusted CDS Clients. Ensure that the aud value matches the CDS Service endpoint currently processing the request. Ensure that the exp value is not before the current date/time. Ensure that the tenant value exists in the CDS Service's whitelist of trusted tenants (may not be applicable to all CDS Services). Ensure that the JWT signature matches the public key on record with the CDS Service. See additional notes below. Ensure that the jti value doesn't exist in the short-term storage of JWTs previously processed by this CDS Service. Once the JWT has been deemed to be valid, the jti value should be stored in the short-term storage of processed JWTs. Values in this storage only need to be kept for the maximum duration of all JWTs processed by this CDS Service. If the CDS Clients are adhering to best practices, this should be no more than an hour. Verifying the JWT signature is a critical step in establishing trust of the caller of the CDS Service. As part of the whitelist of trusted CDS Clients, information on the public key(s) used by the CDS Client should also be stored. In some cases, this public key may be shared out-of-band. In other cases, the public key may be available at a remote endpoint and cycled on a regular basis. It is this latter case in which CDS Services should maintain their own rotating cache of public keys for the CDS Client. CDS Services should never store, share, or log JWTs to minimize the risk of theft and replay attacks. Information within the JWT (for instance, iss , tenant , jti ) can be logged safely and is especially useful for analytics. If a CDS Service deems a JWT to be invalid for any reason, it should not leak the details of why the JWT failed validation back to the caller. If the caller were a malicious threat actor, leaking detailed information as to what was invalid may give the threat actor guidance on how to shape future attacks. Instead, responding to the request with a HTTP 401 Unauthorized response status code without any additional information is recommended. FHIR Access CDS Services should never store, share, or log the FHIR access token ( fhirAuthorization.access_token ) given to it by the CDS Client. The access token should be treated as an extremely sensitive, transient piece of data.","title":"Best Practices"},{"location":"best-practices/#implementation-best-practices","text":"This page serves as best practice guidance for CDS Hooks implementers.

A CDS Hooks scenario typically includes two main actors: an CDS Client and a CDS Service, where the CDS Client may be an EHR, CPOE or other clinical workflow system. Below is an example interaction for the patient-view hook. Building a CDS Service A CDS Service is an external service that responds to CDS Client requests through cards. A card can optionally link to a SMART app. There are several steps to setting up a CDS Service: Create an endpoint for discovery Develop a service Test the service with the sandbox If applicable, create a SMART app (or borrow one ) Test the service (and, if applicable, SMART app) with an CDS Client This tutorial recommends implementing the CDS Hooks security model after successful open access testing. Endpoint for discovery The CDS Service must provide a stable endpoint for the CDS Client to discover the available services. A system must expose their services at {baseUrl}/cds-services . A service endpoint that supports the patient-view hook may return: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 { services : [ { hook : patient-view , name : Static CDS Service Example , description : An example of a CDS Service that returns a card with SMART app recommendations. , id : static-patient-view , prefetch : { patientToGreet : Patient/{{Patient.id}} } } ] } The attributes available to describe a CDS Services is documented in the CDS Hooks specification . Develop a service With a stable open end point available it's time to complete development of a service. A CDS Service could provide information , a suggestion , or a SMART app link. The focus of the Argonaut CDS Hooks effort is a patient-view hook launching a SMART app so this guide will focus on the SMART app link. A CDS patient-view hook could return the following card: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 { cards : [ { summary : SMART App Success Card , indicator : success , detail : This is an example SMART App success card. , source : { label : Static CDS Service Example , url : https://example.com }, links : [ { label : SMART Example App , url : https://smart.example.com/launch , type : smart } ] } ] } Create a SMART App You may already have created a SMART app prior to this step, but just in case this is a reminder. The SMART app is launched from the link returned in your service. If you want to borrow a SMART app, check out the app gallery . Test service with a sandbox The CDS Hooks community provides a publicly available sandbox to test your service. Select the configure hooks: Delete the existing hooks, and then do a quick add with a reference to your CDS Service: After testing with the sandbox, you are ready to connect with an CDS Client. Integrating CDS Services into a CDS Client Build out following sections: Call discovery endpoint Invoke service on patient-view Support FHIR resource on CDS requests (context or pre-fetch) Expose non-secured FHIR server for testing Render card Launch SMART app Test with external CDS Service This tutorial recommends implementing the CDS Hooks security model after successful open access testing. Call discovery endpoint The CDS discovery endpoint provides the list of services a CDS provider supports, and the hooks a service should be invoked on. A CDS Client may configure their system to support a set of hooks at a certain location in their users work flow, or build a dynamic capability to interact with a CDS Service provider within a work flow. For the best end-user experience, this guide recommends a business analyst configure which hooks a CDS Client will support. Below is an example work flow where a business analyst accesses this list of available services by calling GET https://example.com/cds-services and then configures them in the system. This image captures a business analyst reviewing services from one CDS provider. A business analyst may review services from multiple providers and configure appropriate services per user profiles. Invoke service on patient-view hook The patient-view hook is invoked when a patient chart is opened. It's one of the most basic since the logic doesn't have any prior workflow dependencies. The service called on the patient-view hook could be dependent on patient characteristics, for example: sex, problems in problems list, active medications, etc. The current version of the CDS Hooks specification allows the CDS Client to decide which characteristics to consider. Support FHIR resource on CDS requests (context or pre-fetch) Often a CDS Service will require additional information from the CDS Client to perform the decision support logic, or determine the appropriate SMART app to return. Prefetch provides the CDS Client the capability to pass a resource when invoking a service. For example, with a patient resource included a service could do a geography search for potential environmental risk factors. Below is an example request invoked on patient-view with a patient included: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 { hookInstance : 23f1a303-991f-4118-86c5-11d99a39222e , fhirServer : https://fhir.example.org , hook : patient-view , user : Practitioner/example , context : { patientId : 1288992 , }, prefetch : { patientToGreet : { resourceType : Patient , gender : male , birthDate : 1925-12-23 , id : 1288992 , active : true } } } In some cases, additional information beyond what is included in the prefetch may be required. The CDS Service can request additional information using the FHIR REST APIs: GET [base]/AllergyIntolerance?patient=[id] It is recommended FHIR servers implement, and CDS Services follow, locale specific implementation guides. In the US, the recommended implementation guides to follow are the Argonaut Data Query Guide (DSTU2) or HL7 US Core (STU3) . Each profile page within these implementation guides includes queries FHIR servers are required to support. Expose non-secured FHIR server for testing A non-secured FHIR server is important to support testing with a CDS Service. When the CDS Client moves a hook to production the system is expected to follow the guidelines in the security requirements. Render card The CDS Service will provide a response in the form a of a 'card'. Your CDS Client needs to be able to display the card.

We are currently working towards a 1.0 release and would love your feedback and proposed changes. Look at our current issue list and get involved! Overview The CDS Hooks specification describes the RESTful APIs and interactions to integrate Clinical Decision Support (CDS) between CDS Clients (typically Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRs) or other health information systems) and CDS Services. All data exchanged through the RESTful APIs MUST be sent and received as JSON structures, and MUST be transmitted over channels secured using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS), also known as HTTPS and defined in RFC2818 . Conformance Language The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 . Open API Specification An Open API Specification (formally known as the Swagger Specification) interface of CDS Hooks is available. The open source Open API Specification defines a programming language-agnostic method to describe a RESTful API like CDS Hooks. The Open API Specification is used by many projects and is supported by CDS Hooks for the benefit of implementers. CDS Hooks implementers are not required to use the Open API Specification interface of CDS Hooks. You can download the API specification and view it online via the Swagger Editor . CDS Hooks Anatomy This specification describes a \"hook\" -based pattern for invoking decision support from within a clinician's workflow. The API supports: Synchronous, workflow-triggered CDS calls returning information and suggestions Launching a user-facing SMART app when CDS requires additional interaction The basic components of CDS Hooks are: CDS Service A decision support service that accepts requests containing patient information, and provides responses CDS Client or EHR An electronic health record, or other clinical information system that consumes decision support in the form of services MAY provide an authorization and FHIR resource server Hook A defined point within the client system's workflow with well-known contextual information provided as part of the request Card Guidance from decision support services is returned in the form of cards representing discrete recommendations or suggestions that are presented to the user within the CDS Client In CDS Hooks, a CDS Service is a service that provides patient-specific recommendations and guidance through RESTful APIs as described by this specification. The primary APIs are Discovery , which allows a CDS Developer to publish the types of CDS Services it provides, and the Service endpoint that CDS Clients use to request decision support. A CDS Client is an electronic health record, or other clinical information system that consumes decision support by calling CDS Services at specific points in the application's workflow called hooks . Each hook defines the hook context , contextual information available within the client and specific to the workflow. Each service advertises which hooks it supports and what prefetch data (information needed by the CDS Service to determine what decision support should be presented) it requires. Decision support is then returned to the CDS Client in the form of cards , which the client MAY display to the end-user as part of their workflow. Cards may be informational, or they may provide suggestions that the user may accept or reject, or they may provide a link to additional information or even launch a SMART app when additional user interaction is required. Discovery Developers of CDS Services SHALL provide a stable endpoint for allowing CDS Clients to discover available CDS Services, including information such as a description of the CDS Service, when it should be invoked, and any data that is requested to be prefetched. A CDS Service provider SHALL expose its Discovery endpoint at\" 1 { baseURL } /cds-services HTTP Request The discovery endpoint SHALL always be available at {baseUrl}/cds-services . For example, if the baseUrl is https://example.com, the CDS Client MAY invoke: GET https://example.com/cds-services Response The response to the discovery endpoint SHALL be an object containing a list of CDS Services. Field Description services array . An array of CDS Services . Each CDS Service SHALL be described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description hook REQUIRED string The hook this service should be invoked on. See Hooks . title RECOMMENDED string The human-friendly name of this service. description REQUIRED string The description of this service. id REQUIRED string The {id} portion of the URL to this service which is available at {baseUrl}/cds-services/{id} prefetch OPTIONAL object An object containing key/value pairs of FHIR queries that this service is requesting that the CDS Client prefetch and provide on each service call. The key is a string that describes the type of data being requested and the value is a string representing the FHIR query. See Prefetch Template . HTTP Status Codes Code Description 200 OK A successful response. CDS Services MAY return other HTTP statuses, specifically 4xx and 5xx HTTP error codes. Discovery Example 1 curl https://example.com/cds-services The above command returns JSON structured like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 { services : [ { hook : patient-view , title : Static CDS Service Example , description : An example of a CDS Service that returns a static set of cards , id : static-patient-greeter , prefetch : { patientToGreet : Patient/{{context.patientId}} } }, { hook : medication-prescribe , title : Medication Echo CDS Service , description : An example of a CDS Service that simply echos the medication being prescribed , id : medication-echo , prefetch : { patient : Patient/{{context.patientId}} , medications : MedicationRequest?patient={{context.patientId}} } } ] } Calling a CDS Service HTTP Request A CDS Client SHALL call a CDS Service by POST ing a JSON document to the service as described in this section. The CDS Service endpoint can be constructed from the CDS Service base URL and an individual service id as {baseUrl}/cds-services/{service.id} . The request SHALL include a JSON POST body with the following input fields: Field Optionality Type Description hook REQUIRED string The hook that triggered this CDS Service call. See Hooks . hookInstance REQUIRED string A UUID for this particular hook call (see more information below). fhirServer OPTIONAL URL The base URL of the CDS Client's FHIR server. If fhirAuthorization is provided, this field is REQUIRED. The scheme should be https fhirAuthorization OPTIONAL object A structure holding an OAuth 2.0 bearer access token granting the CDS Service access to FHIR resources, along with supplemental information relating to the token. See the FHIR Resource Access section for more information. context REQUIRED object Hook-specific contextual data that the CDS service will need. For example, with the patient-view hook this will include the FHIR identifier of the Patient being viewed. For details, see the Hooks specification page. prefetch OPTIONAL object The FHIR data that was prefetched by the CDS Client (see more information below). hookInstance While working in the CDS Client, a user can perform multiple actions in series or in parallel. For example, a clinician might prescribe two drugs in a row; each prescription action would be assigned a unique hookInstance . This allows a CDS Service to uniquely identify each hook invocation. Note: the hookInstance is globally unique and should contain enough entropy to be un-guessable. Example 1 2 3 4 5 curl -X POST \\ -H Content-type: application/json \\ --data @hook-details-see-example-below https://example.com/cds-services/static-patient-greeter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 { hookInstance : d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea , fhirServer : http://hooks.smarthealthit.org:9080 , hook : patient-view , fhirAuthorization : { access_token : some-opaque-fhir-access-token , token_type : Bearer , expires_in : 300 , scope : patient/Patient.read patient/Observation.read , subject : cds-service4 }, context : { userId : Practitioner/example , patientId : 1288992 , encounterId : 89284 }, prefetch : { patientToGreet : { resourceType : Patient , gender : male , birthDate : 1925-12-23 , id : 1288992 , active : true } } } Providing FHIR Resources to a CDS Service Each CDS Service will require specific FHIR resources in order to compute the recommendations the CDS Client requests. If real-world performance were no issue, an CDS Client could launch a CDS Service passing only context data (such as the current user and patient ids), and the CDS Service could then request authorization for FHIR resources as they were needed, and then retrieve the resources from the CDS Client's FHIR server. Given that CDS Services SHOULD respond quickly (on the order of 500 ms.), this specification defines a process to allow a CDS Service to request and obtain FHIR resources efficiently. Two optional methods are provided. First, FHIR resources MAY be obtained by passing \"prefetched\" data from the CDS Client to the CDS Service in the service call. FHIR resources requested in the CDS Service description are passed as key-value pairs, with each key matching a key described in the CDS Service description, and each value being a FHIR resource. Note that in the case of searches, this resource may be a searchset Bundle. If data are to be prefetched, the CDS Service registers a set of \"prefetch templates\" with the CDS Client, as described in the Prefetch Template section below. The second method enables the CDS Service to retrieve FHIR resources for itself, but to do so more efficiently than if it were required to request and obtain its own authorization. If the CDS Client decides to have the CDS Service fetch its own FHIR resources, the CDS Client obtains and passes directly to the CDS Service a bearer token issued for the CDS Service's use in executing FHIR API calls against the CDS Client's FHIR server to obtain the required resources. Some CDS Clients MAY pass prefetched data, along with a bearer token for the CDS Service to use if additional resources are required. Each CDS Client SHOULD decide which approach, or combination, is preferred, based on performance considerations and assessment of attendant security and safety risks. For more detail, see the FHIR Resource Access section below. Similarly, each CDS Client will decide what FHIR resources to authorize and to prefetch, based on the CDS Service description's \"prefetch\" request and on the provider's assessment of the \"minimum necessary.\" The CDS Client provider and the CDS Service provider will negotiate the set of FHIR resources to be provided, and how these data will be provided, as part of their service agreement. Prefetch Template A prefetch template is a FHIR read or search request that describes relevant data needed by the CDS Service. For example, the following is a prefetch template for hemoglobin A1c observations: 1 Observation?patient={{context.patientId}} code=4548-4 _count=1 sort:desc=date To allow for prefetch templates that are dependent on the workflow context, prefetch templates may include references to context using prefetch tokens . In the above example, {{context.patientId}} is a prefetch token. The prefetch field of a CDS Service description defines the set of prefetch templates for that service, providing a prefetch key for each one that is used to identify the prefetch data in the CDS request. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 { prefetch : { hemoglobin-a1c : Observation?patient={{context.patientId}} code=4548-4 _count=1 sort:desc=date } } In this prefetch , hemoglobin-a1c is the prefetch key for this prefetch template. For a complete worked example, see below . A CDS Client MAY choose to honor some or all of the desired prefetch templates, and is free to choose the most appropriate source for these data. For example: The CDS Client MAY have some of the desired prefetched data already in memory, thereby removing the need for any network call The CDS Client MAY compute an efficient set of prefetch templates from multiple CDS Services, thereby reducing the number of calls to a minimum The CDS Client MAY satisfy some of the desired prefetched templates via some internal service or even its own FHIR server. The CDS Client SHALL deny access to the requested resource if it is outside the user's authorized scope. As part of preparing the request, a CDS Client processes each prefetch template it intends to satisfy by replacing the prefetch tokens in the prefetch template to construct a relative FHIR request URL. This specification is not prescriptive about how this request is actually processed. The relative URL may be appended to the base URL for the CDS Client's FHIR server and directly invoked, or the CDS Client may use internal infrastructure to satisfy the request in the same way that invoking against the FHIR server would. Regardless of how the CDS Client satisfies the prefetch templates (if at all), the prefetched data given to the CDS Service MUST be equivalent to the data the CDS Service would receive if it were making its own call to the CDS Client's FHIR server using the parameterized prefetch template. Note that this means that CDS services will receive only the information they have requested and are authorized to receive. Prefetch data for other services registered to the same hook MUST NOT be provided. In other words, services SHALL only receive the data they requested in their prefetch and for which they are authorized recipients. The resulting response, which MUST be rendered in a single page \u2014 no \"next page\" links allowed \u2014 is passed along to the CDS Service using the prefetch parameter (see below for a complete example). Note that the reason prefetch results are not allowed to include next page links is that if the prefetched data contains just a single page of data, the CDS Service has no means to retrieve the subsequent pages of data. Consider, for example, a CDS Hooks implementation that does not expose a FHIR server. The CDS Client MUST NOT send any prefetch template key that it chooses not to satisfy. Similarly, if the CDS Client encounters an error while prefetching any data, the prefetch template key MUST NOT be sent to the CDS Service. If the CDS Client has no data to populate a template prefetch key, the prefetch template key MUST have a value of null . Note that the null result is used rather than a bundle with zero entries to account for the possibility that the prefetch url is a single-resource request. It is the CDS Service's responsibility to check prefetched data against its template to determine what requests were satisfied (if any) and to manually retrieve any additional necessary data. If the CDS Service is unable to obtain required data because it cannot access the FHIR server and the request did not contain the necessary prefetch keys, the service SHALL respond with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status code. Prefetch tokens A prefetch token is a placeholder in a prefetch template that is replaced by a value from the hook's context to construct the FHIR URL used to request the prefetch data. Prefetch tokens MUST be delimited by {{ and }} , and MUST contain only the qualified path to a hook context field. Individual hooks specify which of their context fields can be used as prefetch tokens. Only root-level fields with a primitive value within the context object are eligible to be used as prefetch tokens. For example, {{context.medication.id}} is not a valid prefetch token because it attempts to access the id field of the medication field. Prefetch query restrictions To reduce the implementation burden on CDS Clients that support CDS Services, this specification RECOMMENDS that prefetch queries only use a subset of the full functionality available in the FHIR specification. Valid prefetch templates SHOULD only make use of: instance level read interactions (for resources with known ids such as Patient and Practitioner ) type level search interactions Patient references (e.g. patient={{context.patientId}} ) token search parameters using equality (e.g. code=4548-4 ) and optionally the :in modifier (no other modifiers for token parameters) date search parameters on date , dateTime , instant , or Period types only, and using only the prefixes eq , lt , gt , ge , le the _count parameter to limit the number of results returned the _sort parameter to allow for most recent and first queries Example prefetch token Often a prefetch template builds on the contextual data associated with the hook. For example, a particular CDS Service might recommend guidance based on a patient's conditions when the chart is opened. The FHIR query to retrieve these conditions might be Condition?patient=123 . In order to express this as a prefetch template, the CDS Service must express the FHIR identifier of the patient as a token so that the CDS Client can replace the token with the appropriate value. When context fields are used as tokens, their token name MUST be context.name-of-the-field . For example, given a context like: 1 2 3 context : { patientId : 123 } The token name would be {{context.patientId}} . Again using our above conditions example, the complete prefetch template would be Condition?patient={{context.patientId}} . Only the first level fields in context may be considered for tokens. Hook creators MUST document which fields in the context are supported as tokens. If a context field can be tokenized, the value of the context field MUST be a JSON primitive data type that can placed into a FHIR query (i.e. a string, a number, or a boolean). For example, given the following context that contains amongst other things, a Patient FHIR resource: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 context : { encounterId : 456 , patient : { resourceType : Patient , id : 123 , active : true , name : [ { use : official , family : Watts , given : [ Wade ] } ], gender : male , birthDate : 2024-08-12 } } Only the encounterId field in this example is eligible to be a prefetch token as it is a first level field and the datatype (string) can be placed into the FHIR query. The Patient.id value in the context is not eligible to be a prefetch token because it is not a first level field. If the hook creator intends for the Patient.id value to be available as a prefetch token, it must be made available as a first level field. Using the aforementioned example, we simply add a new patientId field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 context : { patientId : 123 , encounterId : 456 , patient : { resourceType : Patient , id : 123 , active : true , name : [ { use : official , family : Watts , given : [ Wade ] } ], gender : male , birthDate : 2024-08-12 } } Example prefetch templates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { prefetch : { patient : Patient/{{context.patientId}} , hemoglobin-a1c : Observation?patient={{context.patientId}} code=4548-4 _count=1 sort:desc=date , user : {{context.userId}} } } Here is an example prefetch field from a CDS Service discovery endpoint. The goal is to know, at call time: Key Description patient Patient demographics. hemoglobin-a1c Most recent Hemoglobin A1c reading for this patient. user Information on the current user (Practitioner). Example prefetch data 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 { prefetch : { patient :{ resourceType : Patient , gender : male , birthDate : 1974-12-25 , ... : snipped for brevity }, hemoglobin-a1c : { resourceType : Bundle , type : searchset , entry : [{ resource : { resourceType : Observation , code : { coding : [{ system : http://loinc.org , code : 4548-4 , display : Hemoglobin A1c }] }, ... : snipped for brevity } }] } } } The CDS Hooks request is augmented to include two prefetch values, where the dictionary keys match the request keys ( patient and hemoglobin-a1c in this case). Note that the missing user key indicates that either the CDS Client has decided not to satisfy this particular prefetch template or it was not able to retrieve this prefetched data. The CDS Service is responsible for retrieving this Practitioner data from the FHIR server (if required). FHIR Resource Access If the CDS Client provides both fhirServer and fhirAuthorization request parameters, the CDS Service MAY use the FHIR server to obtain any FHIR resources it requires beyond those provided by the CDS Client as prefetched data. This is similar to the approach used by SMART on FHIR wherein the SMART app requests and ultimately obtains an access token from the CDS Client's Authorization server using the SMART launch workflow, as described in SMART App Launch Implementation Guide . Like SMART on FHIR, CDS Hooks requires that clients present a valid access token to the FHIR server with each API call. Thus, a CDS Service MUST be able to obtain an access token before communicating with the CDS Client's FHIR resource server. While CDS Hooks shares the underlying technical framework and standards as SMART on FHIR, the CDS Hooks workflow MUST accommodate the automated, low-latency delivery of an access token to the CDS service. With CDS Hooks, if the CDS Client wants to provide the CDS Service direct access to FHIR resources, the CDS Client creates an access token prior to invoking the CDS Service, passing this token to the CDS Service as part of the service call. This approach remains compatible with OAuth 2.0's bearer token protocol while minimizing the number of HTTPS round-trips and the service invocation latency. The CDS Client remains in control of creating an access token that is associated with the specific CDS Service, user, and context of the invocation. As the CDS Service executes on behalf of a user, the data to which the CDS Service is given access by the CDS Client MUST be limited to the same restrictions and authorizations afforded the current user. As such, the access token SHALL be scoped to: The CDS Service being invoked The current user Passing the Access Token to the CDS Service The access token is specified in the CDS Service request via the fhirAuthorization request parameter. This parameter is an object that contains both the access token as well as other related information as specified below. If the CDS Client chooses not to pass along an access token, the fhirAuthorization parameter is omitted. Field Optionality Type Description access_token REQUIRED string This is the OAuth 2.0 access token that provides access to the FHIR server. token_type REQUIRED string Fixed value: Bearer expires_in REQUIRED integer The lifetime in seconds of the access token. scope REQUIRED string The scopes the access token grants the CDS Service. subject REQUIRED string The OAuth 2.0 client identifier of the CDS Service, as registered with the CDS Client's authorization server. The scopes granted to the CDS Service via the scope field are defined by the SMART on FHIR specification . The expires_in value is established by the authorization server and SHOULD BE very short lived, as the access token MUST be treated as a transient value by the CDS Service. Below is an example fhirAuthorization parameter: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { fhirAuthorization : { access_token : some-opaque-fhir-access-token , token_type : Bearer , expires_in : 300 , scope : patient/Patient.read patient/Observation.read , subject : cds-service4 } } CDS Service Response For successful responses, CDS Services SHALL respond with a 200 HTTP response with an object containing a cards element as described below. Each card contains decision support from the CDS Service. Generally speaking, cards are intended for display to an end user. The data format of a card defines a very minimal set of required attributes with several more optional attributes to suit a variety of use cases. For instance, narrative informational decision support, actionable suggestions to modify data, and links to SMART apps. Note that because the CDS client may be invoking multiple services from the same hook, there may be multiple responses related to the same information. This specification does not address these scenarios specifically; both CDS Services and CDS Clients should consider the implications of multiple CDS Services in their integrations. HTTP Status Codes Code Description 200 OK A successful response. 412 Precondition Failed The CDS Service is unable to retrieve the necessary FHIR data to execute its decision support, either through a prefetch request or directly calling the FHIR server. CDS Services MAY return other HTTP statuses, specifically 4xx and 5xx HTTP error codes. HTTP Response Field Optionality Type Description cards REQUIRED array An array of Cards . Cards can provide a combination of information (for reading), suggested actions (to be applied if a user selects them), and links (to launch an app if the user selects them). The CDS Client decides how to display cards, but this specification recommends displaying suggestions using buttons, and links using underlined text. If your CDS Service has no decision support for the user, your service should return a 200 HTTP response with an empty array of cards. Response when no decision support is necessary for the user 1 2 3 { cards : [] } Card Attributes Each Card is described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description summary REQUIRED string One-sentence, 140-character summary message for display to the user inside of this card. detail OPTIONAL string Optional detailed information to display; if provided MUST be represented in (GitHub Flavored) Markdown . (For non-urgent cards, the CDS Client MAY hide these details until the user clicks a link like \"view more details...\"). indicator REQUIRED string Urgency/importance of what this card conveys. Allowed values, in order of increasing urgency, are: info , warning , critical . The CDS Client MAY use this field to help make UI display decisions such as sort order or coloring. source REQUIRED object Grouping structure for the Source of the information displayed on this card. The source should be the primary source of guidance for the decision support the card represents. suggestions OPTIONAL array of Suggestions Allows a service to suggest a set of changes in the context of the current activity (e.g. changing the dose of the medication currently being prescribed, for the medication-prescribe activity). If suggestions are present, selectionBehavior MUST also be provided. selectionBehavior OPTIONAL string Describes the intended selection behavior of the suggestions in the card. Currently, the only allowed value is at-most-one , indicating that the user may choose none or at most one of the suggestions. Future versions of the specification may expand this behavior, so CDS Clients that do not understand the value MUST treat the card as an error. CDS Clients MUST support the value of at-most-one . links OPTIONAL array of Links Allows a service to suggest a link to an app that the user might want to run for additional information or to help guide a decision. Source The Source is described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description label REQUIRED string A short, human-readable label to display for the source of the information displayed on this card. If a url is also specified, this MAY be the text for the hyperlink. url OPTIONAL URL An optional absolute URL to load (via GET , in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link to learn more about the organization or data set that provided the information on this card. Note that this URL should not be used to supply a context-specific \"drill-down\" view of the information on this card. For that, use link.url instead. icon OPTIONAL URL An absolute URL to an icon for the source of this card. The icon returned by this URL SHOULD be a 100x100 pixel PNG image without any transparent regions. Suggestion Each Suggestion is described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description label REQUIRED string Human-readable label to display for this suggestion (e.g. the CDS Client might render this as the text on a button tied to this suggestion). uuid OPTIONAL string Unique identifier, used for auditing and logging suggestions. actions OPTIONAL array Array of objects, each defining a suggested action. Within a suggestion, all actions are logically AND'd together, such that a user selecting a suggestion selects all of the actions within it. Action Each Action is described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description type REQUIRED string The type of action being performed. Allowed values are: create , update , delete . description REQUIRED string Human-readable description of the suggested action MAY be presented to the end-user. resource OPTIONAL object Depending upon the type attribute, a new resource or the id of a resource. When the type attribute is create , the resource attribute SHALL contain a new FHIR resource to be created. For delete , this SHALL be the id of the resource to remove. In hooks where only one \"content\" resource is ever relevant, this attribute MAY be omitted for delete action types only. For update , this holds the updated resource in its entirety and not just the changed fields. The following example illustrates a create action: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { type : create , description : Create a prescription for Acetaminophen 250 MG , resource : { resourceType : MedicationRequest , id : medrx001 , ... : snipped for brevity } } The following example illustrates an update action: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { type : update , description : Update the order to record the appropriateness score , resource : { resourceType : ProcedureRequest , id : procedure-request-1 , ... : snipped for brevity } } The following example illustrates a delete action: 1 2 3 4 5 { type : delete , description : Remove the inappropriate order , resource : ProcedureRequest/procedure-request-1 } Link Each Link is described by the following attributes. Field Optionality Type Description label REQUIRED string Human-readable label to display for this link (e.g. the CDS Client might render this as the underlined text of a clickable link). url REQUIRED URL URL to load (via GET , in a browser context) when a user clicks on this link. Note that this MAY be a \"deep link\" with context embedded in path segments, query parameters, or a hash. type REQUIRED string The type of the given URL. There are two possible values for this field. A type of absolute indicates that the URL is absolute and should be treated as-is. A type of smart indicates that the URL is a SMART app launch URL and the CDS Client should ensure the SMART app launch URL is populated with the appropriate SMART launch parameters. appContext OPTIONAL string An optional field that allows the CDS Service to share information from the CDS card with a subsequently launched SMART app. The appContext field should only be valued if the link type is smart and is not valid for absolute links. The appContext field and value will be sent to the SMART app as part of the OAuth 2.0 access token response, alongside the other SMART launch parameters when the SMART app is launched. Note that appContext could be escaped JSON, base64 encoded XML, or even a simple string, so long as the SMART app can recognize it. Example Example response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 { cards : [ { summary : Example Card , indicator : info , detail : This is an example card. , source : { label : Static CDS Service Example , url : https://example.com , icon : https://example.com/img/icon-100px.png }, links : [ { label : Google , url : https://google.com , type : absolute }, { label : Github , url : https://github.com , type : absolute }, { label : SMART Example App , url : https://smart.example.com/launch , type : smart , appContext : {\\ session\\ :3456356,\\ settings\\ :{\\ module\\ :4235}} } ] }, { summary : Another card , indicator : warning , source : { label : Static CDS Service Example } } ] } Security and Safety Security and safety risks associated with the CDS Hooks API include: The risk that confidential information and privileged authorizations transmitted between a CDS Client and a CDS Service could be surreptitiously intercepted by an attacker; The risk that an attacker masquerading as a legitimate CDS Service could receive confidential information or privileged authorizations from a CDS Client, or could provide to a CDS Client decision support recommendations that could be harmful to a patient; The risk that an attacker masquerading as a legitimate service-subscribing CDS Client (i.e., man-in-the-middle) could intercept and possibly alter data exchanged between the two parties. The risk that a CDS Service could embed dangerous suggestions or links to dangerous apps in Cards returned to a CDS Client. The risk that a CDS Hooks browser-based deployment could be victimized by a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) attack. The risk that a CDS Service could return a decision based on outdated patient data, resulting in a safety risk to the patient. CDS Hooks defines a security model that addresses these risks by assuring that the identities of both the CDS Service and the CDS Client are authenticated to each other; by protecting confidential information and privileged authorizations shared between a CDS Client and a CDS Service; by recommending means of assuring data freshness; and by incorporating business mechanisms through which trust is established and maintained between a CDS Client and a CDS Service. Trusting CDS Services Prior to enabling CDS Clients to request decision support from any CDS Service, the CDS Client vendor and/or provider organization is expected to perform due diligence on the CDS Service provider. Each CDS Client vendor/provider is individually responsible for determining the suitability, safety and integrity of the CDS Services it uses, based on the organization's own risk-management strategy. Each CDS Client vendor/provider SHOULD maintain a \"white list\" (and/or \"black list\") of the CDS Services it has vetted, and the Card links that have been deemed safe to display from within the CDS Client context. Each provider organization is expected to work with its CDS Client vendor to choose what CDS Services to allow and to negotiate the conditions under which the CDS Services MAY be called. Once a CDS Service provider is selected, the CDS Client vendor/provider negotiates the terms under which service will be provided. This negotiation includes agreement on patient data elements that will be prefetched and provided to the CDS Service, data elements that will be made available through an access token passed by the CDS Client, and steps the CDS Service MUST take to protect patient data and access tokens. To enable the CDS Client's authorization server to authorize CDS Service access to FHIR resources, the CDS Service is registered as a client to the CDS Client authorization server. These business arrangements are documented in the service agreement. Every interaction between an CDS Client and a CDS Service is initiated by the CDS Client sending a service request to a CDS Service endpoint protected using the Transport Layer Security protocol . Through the TLS protocol the identity of the CDS Service is authenticated, and an encrypted transmission channel is established between the CDS Client and the CDS Service. Both the Discovery endpoint and individual CDS Service endpoints are TLS secured. The authorization server is responsible for enforcing restrictions on the CDS Services that MAY be called and the scope of the FHIR resources that MAY be prefetched or retrieved from the FHIR server. If a CDS Client is satisfying prefetch requests from a CDS Service or sends a non-null fhirAuthorization object to a CDS Service so that it can call the FHIR server, the CDS Service MUST be pre-registered with the authorization server protecting access to the FHIR server. Pre-registration includes registering a CDS client identifier, and agreeing upon the scope of FHIR access that is minimally necessary to provide the clinical decision support required. This specification does not address how the CDS Client, authorization server, and CDS Service perform this pre-registration. Trusting CDS Clients The service agreement negotiated between the CDS Client vendor/provider and the CDS Service provider will include obligations the CDS Client vendor/provider commits to the CDS Service provider. Some agreements MAY include the use of mutual TLS, in which both ends of the channel are authenticated. However, mutual TLS is impractical for many organizations, and because the CDS Client initiates the TLS channel set-up, only the CDS Service endpoint will be authenticated. To enable the CDS Service to authenticate the identity of the CDS Client, CDS Hooks uses digitally signed JSON web tokens (JWT) ( rfc7519 ). Each time a CDS Client transmits a request to a CDS Service, the request MUST include an Authorization header presenting the JWT as a \u201cBearer\u201d token: 1 Authorization: Bearer {{JWT}} Note that this is for every single CDS Service call, whether that be a Discovery call, a single CDS Service invocation, or multiple exchanges relating to a single service. Also note that mutual TLS MAY be used alongside JSON web tokens to establish trust of the CDS Client by the CDS Service. The CDS Client MUST use its private key to digitally sign the JWT, using the JSON Web Signatures (rfc7515) standard. The JWT header contains the following fields (see rfc7515 section 4.1 for further information on these standard headers): Field Optionality Type Value alg REQUIRED string The cryptographic algorithm used to sign this JWT. kid REQUIRED string The identifier of the key-pair used to sign this JWT. This identifier MUST be unique within the CDS Client's JWK Set. typ REQUIRED string Fixed value: JWT jku OPTIONAL url The URL to the JWK Set containing the public key(s). The JWT payload contains the following fields: Field Optionality Type Value iss REQUIRED string The URI of the issuer of this JWT. Note that the JWT MAY be self-issued by the CDS Client, or MAY be issued by a third-party identity provider. aud REQUIRED string or array of string The CDS Service endpoint that is being called by the CDS Client. (See more details below). exp REQUIRED number Expiration time integer for this authentication JWT, expressed in seconds since the \"Epoch\" (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). iat REQUIRED number The time at which this JWT was issued, expressed in seconds since the \"Epoch\" (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC). jti REQUIRED string A nonce string value that uniquely identifies this authentication JWT (used to protect against replay attacks). tenant OPTIONAL string An opaque string identifying the healthcare organization that is invoking the CDS Hooks request. CDS Services SHOULD whitelist the iss , jku and sub fields to only the CDS Clients they trust. Per rfc7519 , the aud value is either a string or an array of strings. For CDS Hooks, this value MUST be the URL of the CDS Service endpoint being invoked. For example, consider a CDS Service available at a base URL of https://cds.example.org . When the CDS Client invokes the CDS Service discovery endpoint, the aud value is either \"https://cds.example.org/cds-services\" or [\"https://cds.example.org/cds-services\"] . Similarly, when the CDS Client invokes a particular CDS Service (say, some-service ), the aud value is either \"https://cds.example.org/cds-services/some-service\" or [\"https://cds.example.org/cds-services/some-service\"] . The CDS Client MUST make its public key, expressed as a JSON Web Key (JWK) in a JWK Set, as defined by rfc7517 . The kid value from the JWT header allows a CDS Service to identify the correct JWK in the JWK Set that can be used to verify the signature. The CDS Client MAY make its JWK Set available via a URL identified by the jku header field, as defined by rfc7515 4.1.2 . If the jku header field is ommitted, the CDS Client and CDS Service SHALL communicate the JWK Set out-of-band. JWT Signing Algorithm The cryptographic signing algorithm of JWT is indicated in the alg header field. JSON Web Algorithms (rfc7518) defines several cryptographic algorithms for use in signing JWTs and should be referenced by CDS Hooks implementers. JWTs SHALL NOT be signed used the none algorithm, referred to in rfc7518 as unsecured JSON Web Signatures, as the lack of a cryptographic signature does not provide any integrity protection. Such JWTs could not be used by a CDS Service to identity the CDS Client preventing an establishment of trust. JWTs SHALL NOT be signed using any symmetric algorithm as these algorithms require the CDS Client and CDS Service to share a private key in order to verify the signature. For example, all HMAC based algorithms rely upon a shared private key and thus SHALL NOT be used to sign a JWT. When choosing an algorithm to sign their JWTs, CDS Clients SHOULD consider not only the algorithms (and key sizes) that are recommended within the security industry, but also how well those algorithms are supported in the various programming languages and libraries that may be used by CDS Services. At publication time of this specification, both ES384 and RS384 are RECOMMENDED for their regard within the larger security industry, strength, and support across popular programming languages and libraries. However, stronger and better algorithms are continually being introduced due to new threats, weaknesses, and increases in computing power. CDS Clients SHOULD continually re-evaluate their choice of an algorithm based upon these ever changing conditions. CDS Services SHOULD consider the algorithms they understand and trust based upon their tolerance for risk.

CORS is a client-side security mechanism with well-documented security risks. CDS Services and browser-based CDS Clients will require CORS support. A secure implementation guide for CORS is outside of the scope of this CDS Hooks specification. Organizations planning to implement CDS Hooks with CORS support are referred to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing section of the OWASP HTML5 Security Cheat Sheet . Extensions The specification is not prescriptive about support for extensions. However, to support extensions, the specification reserves the name extension and will never define an element with that name, allowing implementations to use it to provide custom behavior and information. The value of an extension element MUST be a pre-coordinated JSON object. For example, an extension on a request could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { hookInstance : d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea , fhirServer : http://fhir.example.org:9080 , hook : patient-view , context : { userId : Practitioner/example }, extension : { com.example.timestamp : 2017-11-27T22:13:25Z , myextension-practitionerspecialty : gastroenterology } } As another example, an extension defined on the discovery response could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 { services : [ { title : Example CDS Service Discovery , hook : patient-view , id : patientview , prefetch : { patient : Patient/{{context.patientId}} }, description : clinical decision support for patient view , extension : { example-client-conformance : http://hooks.example.org/fhir/102/Conformance/patientview } } ] } Hooks Overview As a specification, CDS Hooks does not prescribe a default or required set of hooks for implementers. Rather, the set of hooks defined here are merely a set of common use cases that were used to aid in the creation of CDS Hooks. The set of hooks defined here are not a closed set; anyone is able to define new hooks to fit their use cases and propose those hooks to the community. New hooks are proposed in a prescribed format using the documentation template by submitting a pull request . Hooks are versioned , and mature according to the Hook Maturity Model . Note that each hook (e.g. medication-prescribe ) represents something the user is doing in the CDS Client and multiple CDS Services might respond to the same hook (e.g. a \"price check\" service and a \"prior authorization\" service might both respond to medication-prescribe ). Hook context and prefetch What's the difference? Any user workflow or action within a CDS Client will naturally include contextual information such as the current user and patient. CDS Hooks refers to this information as context and allows each hook to define the information that is available in the context. Because CDS Hooks is intended to support usage within any CDS Client, this context can contain both required and optional data, depending on the capabilities of individual CDS Clients. However, the context information is intended to be relevant to most CDS Services subscribing to the hook. For example, consider a simple patient-view hook that is invoked whenever the user views a patient's information within the CDS Client. At this point in the workflow, the contextual information would include at least the current user and the patient that is being viewed. The hook declares this as context , and passes it to the CDS Service as part of the request in the context field: 1 2 3 4 context : { userId : Practitioner/123 , patientId : 1288992 } Prefetch data, on the other hand, is defined by CDS Services as a way to allow the CDS Client to provide the data that a CDS Service needs as part of the initial request to the service. When the context data relates to a FHIR resource, it is important not to conflate context and prefetch. For instance, in the hook described above for opening a patient's chart, the hook includes the id of the patient whose chart is being opened, not the full patient FHIR resource. In this case, the FHIR identifier of the patient is appropriate as CDS Services may not be interested in details about the patient resource but instead other data related to this patient. Or, a CDS Service may only need the full patient resource in certain scenarios. Therefore, including the full patient resource in context would be unnecessary. For CDS Services that want the full patient resource, they can request it to be prefetched or fetch it as needed from the FHIR server using a prefetch template in their discovery response, such as: 1 2 3 prefetch : { patientToGreet : Patient/{{context.patientId}} } See the section on prefetch tokens for more information on how contextual information can be used to parameterize prefetch templates. Consider another hook for when a new patient is being registered. In this case, it would likely be appropriate for the context to contain the full FHIR resource for the patient being registered as the patient may not be yet recorded in the CDS Client (and thus not available from the FHIR server) and CDS Services using this hook would predominantly be interested in the details of the patient being registered. Additionally, consider a PGX CDS Service and a Zika screening CDS Service, each of which is subscribed to the same hook. The context data specified by their shared hook should contain data relevant to both CDS Services; however, each service will have other specific data needs that will necessitate disparate prefetch requests. For instance, the PGX CDS Service likely is interested in genomics data whereas the Zika screening CDS Service will want Observations. In summary, context is specified in the hook definition to guide developers on the information available at the point in the workflow when the hook is triggered. Prefetch data is defined by each CDS Service because it is specific to the information that service needs in order to process. Hook Definition Format Hooks are defined in the following format. hook-name-expressed-as-noun-verb The name of the hook SHOULD succinctly and clearly describe the activity or event. Hook names are unique so hook creators SHOULD take care to ensure newly proposed hooks do not conflict with an existing hook name. Hook creators SHALL name their hook with reverse domain notation (e.g. org.example.patient-transmogrify ) if the hook is specific to an organization. Reverse domain notation SHALL not be used by a standard hooks catalog. When naming hooks, the name should start with the subject (noun) of the hook and be followed by the activity (verb). For example, patient-view (not view-patient ) or medication-prescribe (not prescribe-medication ). Workflow Describe when this hook occurs in a workflow. Hook creators SHOULD include as much detail and clarity as possible to minimize any ambiguity or confusion amongst implementors. Context Describe the set of contextual data used by this hook. Only data logically and necessarily associated with the purpose of this hook should be represented in context. All fields defined by the hook's context MUST be defined in a table where each field is described by the following attributes: Field: The name of the field in the context JSON object. Hook authors SHOULD name their context fields to be consistent with other existing hooks when referring to the same context field. Optionality: A string value of either REQUIRED or OPTIONAL Prefetch Token: A string value of either Yes or No , indicating whether this field can be tokenized in a prefetch template. Type: The type of the field in the context JSON object, expressed as the JSON type, or the name of a FHIR Resource type. Valid types are boolean , string , number , object , array , or the name of a FHIR resource type. When a field can be of multiple types, type names MUST be separated by a pipe ( | ) Description: A functional description of the context value. If this value can change according to the FHIR version in use, the description SHOULD describe the value for each supported FHIR version. The table below illustrates a sample hook context table: Field Optionality Prefetch Token Type Description someField REQUIRED Yes string A clear description of the value of this field. anotherField OPTIONAL No number A clear description of the value of this field. someObject REQUIRED No object A clear description of the value of this field. moreObjects OPTIONAL No array A clear description of the items in this array. allFHIR OPTIONAL No object A FHIR Bundle of the following FHIR resources using a specific version of FHIR. FHIR resources in context For context fields that may contain multiple FHIR resources, the field SHOULD be defined as a FHIR Bundle, rather than as an array of FHIR resources. For example, multiple FHIR resources are necessary to describe all of the orders under review in the order-review hook's orders field. Hook definitions SHOULD prefer the use of FHIR Bundles over other bespoke data structures. Often, context is populated with in-progress or in-memory data that may not yet be available from the FHIR server. For example, imagine a hook, medication-order that is invoked when a user selects a medication durating an order workflow. The context data for this hook would contain draft FHIR resources representing the medications that have been selected for ordering. In this case, the CDS Client should only provide these draft resources and not the full set of orders available from its FHIR server. The CDS service MAY pre-fetch or query for FHIR resources with other statuses. All FHIR resources in context MUST be based on the same FHIR version. Examples Hook creators SHOULD include examples of the context. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 context : { someField : foo , anotherField : 123 , someObject : { color : red , version : 1 }, moreObjects :[] } If the context contains FHIR data, hook creators SHOULD include examples across multiple versions of FHIR if differences across FHIR versions are possible. Hook Maturity Model The intent of the CDS Hooks Maturity Model is to attain broad community engagement and consensus, before a hook is labeled as mature, that the hook is necessary, implementable, and worthwhile to the CDS services and CDS clients that would reasonably be expected to use it. Implementer feedback should drive the maturity of new hooks. Diverse participation in open developer forums and events, such as HL7 FHIR Connectathons, is necessary to achieve significant implementer feedback. The below criteria will be evaluated with these goals in mind. 1 Hook maturity | 3 - Considered The Hook maturity levels use the term CDS client to generically refer to the clinical workflow system in which a CDS services returned cards are displayed. Maturity Level Maturity title Requirements 0 Draft Hook is defined according to the hook definition format . 1 Submitted The above, and \u2026 Hook definition is written up as a github pull request using the Hook template and community feedback is solicited on the zulip CDS Hooks stream . 2 Tested The above, and \u2026 The hook has been tested and successfully supports interoperability among at least one CDS client and two independent CDS services using semi-realistic data and scenarios (e.g. at a FHIR Connectathon). The github pull request defining the hook is approved and published. 3 Considered The above, and \u2026 At least 3 distinct organizations recorded ten distinct implementer comments (including a github issue, tracker item, or comment on the hook definition page), including at least two CDS clients and three independent CDS services. The hook has been tested at two connectathons. 4 Documented The above, and \u2026 The author agrees that the artifact is sufficiently stable to require implementer consultation for subsequent non-backward compatible changes. The hook is implemented in the standard CDS Hooks sandbox and multiple prototype projects. The Hook specification SHALL: Identify a broad set of example contexts in which the hook may be used with a minimum of three, but as many as 8-10. Clearly differentiate the hook from similar hooks or other standards to help an implementer determine if the hook is correct for their scenario. Explicitly document example scenarios when the hook should not be used. 5 Mature The above, and ... The hook has been implemented in production in at least two CDS clients and three independent CDS services. An HL7 working group ballots the hook and the hook has passed HL7 STU ballot. 6 Normative The above, and ... the responsible HL7 working group and the CDS working group agree the material is ready to lock down and the hook has passed HL7 normative ballot Changes to a Hook Each hook MUST include a Metadata table at the beginning of the hook with the specification version and hook version as described in the following sections. Specification Version Because hooks are such an integral part of the CDS Hooks specification, hook definitions are associated with specific versions of the specification. The hook definition MUST include the version (or versions) of the CDS Hooks specification that it is defined to work with. 1 specificationVersion | 1.0 Because the specification itself follows semantic versioning, the version specified here is a minimum specification version. In other words, a hook defined to work against 1.0 should continue to work against the 1.1 version of CDS Hooks. However, a hook that specifies 1.1 would not be expected to work in a CDS Hooks 1.0 environment. Hook Version To enable tracking of changes to hook definitions, each hook MUST include a version indicator, expressed as a string. 1 hookVersion | 1.0 To help ensure the stability of CDS Hooks implementations, once a hook has been defined (i.e. published with a particular name so that it is available for implementation), breaking changes MUST NOT be made. This means that fields can be added and restrictions relaxed, but fields cannot be changed, and restrictions cannot be tightened. In particular, the semantics of a hook (i.e. the meaning of the hook from the perspective of the CDS Client) cannot be changed. CDS Clients that implement specific hooks are responsible for ensuring the hook is called from the appropriate point in the workflow. Note that this means that the name of the hook carries major version semantics. That is not to say that the name must include the major version, that is left as a choice to authors of the specification. For example, following version 1.x, the major version MAY be included in the name as \"-2\", \"-3\", etc. Eg: patient-view-2, patient-view-3, etc. Clean hook names increase usability. Ideally, an active hook name accurately defines the meaning and workflow of the hook in actual words. The following types of changes are possible for a hook definition: Change Version Impact Clarifications and corrections to documentation that do not impact functionality Patch Change of prefetch token status of an existing context field Major Addition of a new, REQUIRED field to the context Major Addition of a new, OPTIONAL field to the context Minor Change of optionality of an existing context field Major Change of type or cardinality of an existing context field Major Removal of an existing context field Major Change of semantics of an existing context field Major Change of semantics of the hook Major When a major change is made, the hook definition MUST be published under a new name. When a minor or patch change is made, the hook version MUST be updated. Hook definers MUST use semantic versioning to communicate the impact of changes in an industry standard way. Note that the intent of this table is to outline possible breaking changes. The authors have attempted to enumerate these types of changes exhaustively, but as new types of breaking changes are identified, this list will be updated. Hook Maturity As each hook progresses through a process of being defined, tested, implemented, used in production environments, and balloted, the hook's formal maturity level increases. Each hook has its own maturity level, which MUST be defined in the hook's definition and correspond to the Hook Maturity Model . 1 hookMaturity | 0 - Draft Change Log Changes made to a hook's definition MUST be documented in a change log to ensure hook consumers can track what has been changed over the life of a hook.

The primary APIs are Discovery , which allows a CDS Developer to publish the types of CDS Services it provides, and the Service endpoint that CDS Clients use to request decision support. A CDS Client is an electronic health record, or other clinical information system that consumes decision support by calling CDS Services at specific points in the application's workflow called hooks . Each hook defines the hook context , contextual information available within the client and specific to the workflow.

If real-world performance were no issue, an CDS Client could launch a CDS Service passing only context data (such as the current user and patient ids), and the CDS Service could then request authorization for FHIR resources as they were needed, and then retrieve the resources from the CDS Client's FHIR server. Given that CDS Services SHOULD respond quickly (on the order of 500 ms.), this specification defines a process to allow a CDS Service to request and obtain FHIR resources efficiently. Two optional methods are provided. First, FHIR resources MAY be obtained by passing \"prefetched\" data from the CDS Client to the CDS Service in the service call. FHIR resources requested in the CDS Service description are passed as key-value pairs, with each key matching a key described in the CDS Service description, and each value being a FHIR resource. Note that in the case of searches, this resource may be a searchset Bundle. If data are to be prefetched, the CDS Service registers a set of \"prefetch templates\" with the CDS Client, as described in the Prefetch Template section below. The second method enables the CDS Service to retrieve FHIR resources for itself, but to do so more efficiently than if it were required to request and obtain its own authorization. If the CDS Client decides to have the CDS Service fetch its own FHIR resources, the CDS Client obtains and passes directly to the CDS Service a bearer token issued for the CDS Service's use in executing FHIR API calls against the CDS Client's FHIR server to obtain the required resources. Some CDS Clients MAY pass prefetched data, along with a bearer token for the CDS Service to use if additional resources are required. Each CDS Client SHOULD decide which approach, or combination, is preferred, based on performance considerations and assessment of attendant security and safety risks. For more detail, see the FHIR Resource Access section below. Similarly, each CDS Client will decide what FHIR resources to authorize and to prefetch, based on the CDS Service description's \"prefetch\" request and on the provider's assessment of the \"minimum necessary.\" The CDS Client provider and the CDS Service provider will negotiate the set of FHIR resources to be provided, and how these data will be provided, as part of their service agreement.","title":"Providing FHIR Resources to a CDS Service"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#prefetch-template","text":"A prefetch template is a FHIR read or search request that describes relevant data needed by the CDS Service. For example, the following is a prefetch template for hemoglobin A1c observations: 1 Observation?patient={{context.patientId}} code=4548-4 _count=1 sort:desc=date To allow for prefetch templates that are dependent on the workflow context, prefetch templates may include references to context using prefetch tokens . In the above example, {{context.patientId}} is a prefetch token. The prefetch field of a CDS Service description defines the set of prefetch templates for that service, providing a prefetch key for each one that is used to identify the prefetch data in the CDS request. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 { prefetch : { hemoglobin-a1c : Observation?patient={{context.patientId}} code=4548-4 _count=1 sort:desc=date } } In this prefetch , hemoglobin-a1c is the prefetch key for this prefetch template. For a complete worked example, see below . A CDS Client MAY choose to honor some or all of the desired prefetch templates, and is free to choose the most appropriate source for these data. For example: The CDS Client MAY have some of the desired prefetched data already in memory, thereby removing the need for any network call The CDS Client MAY compute an efficient set of prefetch templates from multiple CDS Services, thereby reducing the number of calls to a minimum The CDS Client MAY satisfy some of the desired prefetched templates via some internal service or even its own FHIR server. The CDS Client SHALL deny access to the requested resource if it is outside the user's authorized scope. As part of preparing the request, a CDS Client processes each prefetch template it intends to satisfy by replacing the prefetch tokens in the prefetch template to construct a relative FHIR request URL. This specification is not prescriptive about how this request is actually processed. The relative URL may be appended to the base URL for the CDS Client's FHIR server and directly invoked, or the CDS Client may use internal infrastructure to satisfy the request in the same way that invoking against the FHIR server would. Regardless of how the CDS Client satisfies the prefetch templates (if at all), the prefetched data given to the CDS Service MUST be equivalent to the data the CDS Service would receive if it were making its own call to the CDS Client's FHIR server using the parameterized prefetch template. Note that this means that CDS services will receive only the information they have requested and are authorized to receive.

In other words, services SHALL only receive the data they requested in their prefetch and for which they are authorized recipients. The resulting response, which MUST be rendered in a single page \u2014 no \"next page\" links allowed \u2014 is passed along to the CDS Service using the prefetch parameter (see below for a complete example). Note that the reason prefetch results are not allowed to include next page links is that if the prefetched data contains just a single page of data, the CDS Service has no means to retrieve the subsequent pages of data. Consider, for example, a CDS Hooks implementation that does not expose a FHIR server. The CDS Client MUST NOT send any prefetch template key that it chooses not to satisfy. Similarly, if the CDS Client encounters an error while prefetching any data, the prefetch template key MUST NOT be sent to the CDS Service. If the CDS Client has no data to populate a template prefetch key, the prefetch template key MUST have a value of null . Note that the null result is used rather than a bundle with zero entries to account for the possibility that the prefetch url is a single-resource request. It is the CDS Service's responsibility to check prefetched data against its template to determine what requests were satisfied (if any) and to manually retrieve any additional necessary data. If the CDS Service is unable to obtain required data because it cannot access the FHIR server and the request did not contain the necessary prefetch keys, the service SHALL respond with an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status code.","title":"Prefetch Template"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#prefetch-tokens","text":"A prefetch token is a placeholder in a prefetch template that is replaced by a value from the hook's context to construct the FHIR URL used to request the prefetch data.

Individual hooks specify which of their context fields can be used as prefetch tokens.

For example, a particular CDS Service might recommend guidance based on a patient's conditions when the chart is opened. The FHIR query to retrieve these conditions might be Condition?patient=123 . In order to express this as a prefetch template, the CDS Service must express the FHIR identifier of the patient as a token so that the CDS Client can replace the token with the appropriate value. When context fields are used as tokens, their token name MUST be context.name-of-the-field . For example, given a context like: 1 2 3 context : { patientId : 123 } The token name would be {{context.patientId}} . Again using our above conditions example, the complete prefetch template would be Condition?patient={{context.patientId}} . Only the first level fields in context may be considered for tokens. Hook creators MUST document which fields in the context are supported as tokens. If a context field can be tokenized, the value of the context field MUST be a JSON primitive data type that can placed into a FHIR query (i.e. a string, a number, or a boolean). For example, given the following context that contains amongst other things, a Patient FHIR resource: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 context : { encounterId : 456 , patient : { resourceType : Patient , id : 123 , active : true , name : [ { use : official , family : Watts , given : [ Wade ] } ], gender : male , birthDate : 2024-08-12 } } Only the encounterId field in this example is eligible to be a prefetch token as it is a first level field and the datatype (string) can be placed into the FHIR query. The Patient.id value in the context is not eligible to be a prefetch token because it is not a first level field. If the hook creator intends for the Patient.id value to be available as a prefetch token, it must be made available as a first level field.

Like SMART on FHIR, CDS Hooks requires that clients present a valid access token to the FHIR server with each API call. Thus, a CDS Service MUST be able to obtain an access token before communicating with the CDS Client's FHIR resource server. While CDS Hooks shares the underlying technical framework and standards as SMART on FHIR, the CDS Hooks workflow MUST accommodate the automated, low-latency delivery of an access token to the CDS service. With CDS Hooks, if the CDS Client wants to provide the CDS Service direct access to FHIR resources, the CDS Client creates an access token prior to invoking the CDS Service, passing this token to the CDS Service as part of the service call. This approach remains compatible with OAuth 2.0's bearer token protocol while minimizing the number of HTTPS round-trips and the service invocation latency. The CDS Client remains in control of creating an access token that is associated with the specific CDS Service, user, and context of the invocation. As the CDS Service executes on behalf of a user, the data to which the CDS Service is given access by the CDS Client MUST be limited to the same restrictions and authorizations afforded the current user.

Each CDS Client vendor/provider SHOULD maintain a \"white list\" (and/or \"black list\") of the CDS Services it has vetted, and the Card links that have been deemed safe to display from within the CDS Client context. Each provider organization is expected to work with its CDS Client vendor to choose what CDS Services to allow and to negotiate the conditions under which the CDS Services MAY be called. Once a CDS Service provider is selected, the CDS Client vendor/provider negotiates the terms under which service will be provided. This negotiation includes agreement on patient data elements that will be prefetched and provided to the CDS Service, data elements that will be made available through an access token passed by the CDS Client, and steps the CDS Service MUST take to protect patient data and access tokens. To enable the CDS Client's authorization server to authorize CDS Service access to FHIR resources, the CDS Service is registered as a client to the CDS Client authorization server. These business arrangements are documented in the service agreement. Every interaction between an CDS Client and a CDS Service is initiated by the CDS Client sending a service request to a CDS Service endpoint protected using the Transport Layer Security protocol . Through the TLS protocol the identity of the CDS Service is authenticated, and an encrypted transmission channel is established between the CDS Client and the CDS Service.

However, mutual TLS is impractical for many organizations, and because the CDS Client initiates the TLS channel set-up, only the CDS Service endpoint will be authenticated. To enable the CDS Service to authenticate the identity of the CDS Client, CDS Hooks uses digitally signed JSON web tokens (JWT) ( rfc7519 ). Each time a CDS Client transmits a request to a CDS Service, the request MUST include an Authorization header presenting the JWT as a \u201cBearer\u201d token: 1 Authorization: Bearer {{JWT}} Note that this is for every single CDS Service call, whether that be a Discovery call, a single CDS Service invocation, or multiple exchanges relating to a single service.

For example, an extension on a request could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 { hookInstance : d1577c69-dfbe-44ad-ba6d-3e05e953b2ea , fhirServer : http://fhir.example.org:9080 , hook : patient-view , context : { userId : Practitioner/example }, extension : { com.example.timestamp : 2017-11-27T22:13:25Z , myextension-practitionerspecialty : gastroenterology } } As another example, an extension defined on the discovery response could look like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 { services : [ { title : Example CDS Service Discovery , hook : patient-view , id : patientview , prefetch : { patient : Patient/{{context.patientId}} }, description : clinical decision support for patient view , extension : { example-client-conformance : http://hooks.example.org/fhir/102/Conformance/patientview } } ] }","title":"Extensions"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#hooks","text":"","title":"Hooks"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#overview_1","text":"As a specification, CDS Hooks does not prescribe a default or required set of hooks for implementers. Rather, the set of hooks defined here are merely a set of common use cases that were used to aid in the creation of CDS Hooks. The set of hooks defined here are not a closed set; anyone is able to define new hooks to fit their use cases and propose those hooks to the community. New hooks are proposed in a prescribed format using the documentation template by submitting a pull request . Hooks are versioned , and mature according to the Hook Maturity Model . Note that each hook (e.g. medication-prescribe ) represents something the user is doing in the CDS Client and multiple CDS Services might respond to the same hook (e.g. a \"price check\" service and a \"prior authorization\" service might both respond to medication-prescribe ).","title":"Overview"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#hook-context-and-prefetch","text":"","title":"Hook context and prefetch"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#whats-the-difference","text":"Any user workflow or action within a CDS Client will naturally include contextual information such as the current user and patient. CDS Hooks refers to this information as context and allows each hook to define the information that is available in the context. Because CDS Hooks is intended to support usage within any CDS Client, this context can contain both required and optional data, depending on the capabilities of individual CDS Clients. However, the context information is intended to be relevant to most CDS Services subscribing to the hook. For example, consider a simple patient-view hook that is invoked whenever the user views a patient's information within the CDS Client. At this point in the workflow, the contextual information would include at least the current user and the patient that is being viewed. The hook declares this as context , and passes it to the CDS Service as part of the request in the context field: 1 2 3 4 context : { userId : Practitioner/123 , patientId : 1288992 } Prefetch data, on the other hand, is defined by CDS Services as a way to allow the CDS Client to provide the data that a CDS Service needs as part of the initial request to the service. When the context data relates to a FHIR resource, it is important not to conflate context and prefetch. For instance, in the hook described above for opening a patient's chart, the hook includes the id of the patient whose chart is being opened, not the full patient FHIR resource. In this case, the FHIR identifier of the patient is appropriate as CDS Services may not be interested in details about the patient resource but instead other data related to this patient. Or, a CDS Service may only need the full patient resource in certain scenarios. Therefore, including the full patient resource in context would be unnecessary. For CDS Services that want the full patient resource, they can request it to be prefetched or fetch it as needed from the FHIR server using a prefetch template in their discovery response, such as: 1 2 3 prefetch : { patientToGreet : Patient/{{context.patientId}} } See the section on prefetch tokens for more information on how contextual information can be used to parameterize prefetch templates. Consider another hook for when a new patient is being registered. In this case, it would likely be appropriate for the context to contain the full FHIR resource for the patient being registered as the patient may not be yet recorded in the CDS Client (and thus not available from the FHIR server) and CDS Services using this hook would predominantly be interested in the details of the patient being registered. Additionally, consider a PGX CDS Service and a Zika screening CDS Service, each of which is subscribed to the same hook. The context data specified by their shared hook should contain data relevant to both CDS Services; however, each service will have other specific data needs that will necessitate disparate prefetch requests. For instance, the PGX CDS Service likely is interested in genomics data whereas the Zika screening CDS Service will want Observations. In summary, context is specified in the hook definition to guide developers on the information available at the point in the workflow when the hook is triggered. Prefetch data is defined by each CDS Service because it is specific to the information that service needs in order to process.","title":"What's the difference?"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#hook-definition-format","text":"Hooks are defined in the following format.","title":"Hook Definition Format"},{"location":"specification/1.0/#hook-name-expressed-as-noun-verb","text":"The name of the hook SHOULD succinctly and clearly describe the activity or event.

For example, imagine a hook, medication-order that is invoked when a user selects a medication durating an order workflow. The context data for this hook would contain draft FHIR resources representing the medications that have been selected for ordering.

This means that fields can be added and restrictions relaxed, but fields cannot be changed, and restrictions cannot be tightened. In particular, the semantics of a hook (i.e. the meaning of the hook from the perspective of the CDS Client) cannot be changed. CDS Clients that implement specific hooks are responsible for ensuring the hook is called from the appropriate point in the workflow. Note that this means that the name of the hook carries major version semantics. That is not to say that the name must include the major version, that is left as a choice to authors of the specification. For example, following version 1.x, the major version MAY be included in the name as \"-2\", \"-3\", etc. Eg: patient-view-2, patient-view-3, etc. Clean hook names increase usability.
